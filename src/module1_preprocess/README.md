## 🛠️ Key Operations
* **Text Normalization:** Removing noise and special characters from ticket descriptions.
* **Sentiment Scoring:** Applying initial sentiment labels to provide context for the Knowledge Graph.
* **Data Formatting:** Standardizing dates and categorical fields into a uniform structure.



## 📂 File Description
